# House-Price-Prediction

#### Tools used - R Studio

- This project is about house price predcition using R. 

- Every year, house prices rise, necessitating the creation of a system to forecast future house prices. 

- House price prediction may assist an individual in determining the selling price of a home and in determining the best time to buy a home. 

- Physical conditions, concept, and location are the three factors that mainly affect the price of a home. 

- The models fitted on multi-class imbalanced data gave a balanced accuracy on classes, “Average”, “Good” and “Poor”, respectively on test data. 

- This project uses regression analysis to forecast house prices, and resampling methods are used to propose the best fit for the model. In addition, regression analysis is used to find the best coefficient for prediction.
